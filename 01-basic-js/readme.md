what is js and why wwee use it ?

-js is logic based programming language wher we can create our code project functionaliry .
-js is a high level programming language for building web pages.
-now we use the ES6(echma script 6) version of the js , in other word we call it vanila js.
-runtime enviornment of js is node js.

-variable :-
    -variable is a cointainer to store the data .
    -in js we have 3 types of variable.
         1.let
            >let is the type of variable whose value can be changed .
            >now a days , most of the cases we use let for creating a variable.
            >let is a block scope code.
         2.var
            >var is also a type of variable whose value can be changed lateer.
            >var was being use in older browsers , so now a days its not in the practice.
         3.const
            >As the name explains is the type of variable where we cann't change the value any further.


Rules of Variable ::-
      -variable names are case sensitive.
      -only letter,digit,underscore and $ is allowed in the variable name.
      -only letter, _ and $ is allowed to be the first character of the variable name.
      -reserve words cann't be used as the variable name.


data types in js ::-
      -data type is an attribute which is associated with the data , which tells the computer system how to interpret its value.
      -in js there are mainly two types of data type
         1.primitive data type.
         2.non-primitive data type.

      1.primitive data type:
         >in js there are 7 types of data type.
            a.Number : cointains some numerical value.
            b.string : cointains some character like names.
            c.Boolean : cointains boolean value like true or false.
            d.Undefined : in undefined data type the data is not defined , so it will show undefined.
            e.Null : here the value is null.
            f.Bigint : in bigint we will get Big integer value.
            g.Symbol : in symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value of we get for the data type.

      2.Non-primitive or reference
         >non primitive data types are the type of data types , that can hold multiple items in a single time.
            a.object
            b.array
            c.function

             a.object
               -object can hold multiple items in one single entity.
               -mainly object work on (key:value) pair.
               -the left hand side is our key , and right hand side are the values of the following object.


            ex.
             
               dibya= {
                  college = "giet",
                  address = "bbsr",
                  age = "22",
                  salary = "50000",
                  carrier="good"
               }


operators in js ::
   -operators are the key features to do some task or operate some task.

   ex. a+b

   1.Arithmetic operators :
         >(+,-,*,/)

         modulus -- %
         exponentiation -- **

   2.unary operator :

         increment -- (++)
         decrement -- (--)
         
   3.assignment operator :
         (=,+=,-=,*=,%=,**=)


   4.comparision operator :
         < it gives a boolean value(true,false)

         equalto -- (=)
         not equal to --(!=)
         equal to & type --(===)
         not equal to & type --(!==)
         (<,<=,>,>=)

   5.Logical operator :
      (||,&&)

      T+T=T
      F+T=F

   6.conditional statement :

      -There are 3 types of conditional statement are there;
         1.if condition
         2.if-else condition
         3.else-if condition
